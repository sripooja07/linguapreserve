- Students and young learners
- Teachers and researchers
- Cultural and linguistic organizations

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Users can record native language audio
- System cleans and preprocesses audio
- Convert speech to text using AI
- Train AI voice models for local languages
- Store audio and text in a digital archive
- Provide interactive language learning modules
- Allow access via web and mobile applications

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Easy-to-use interface
- Scalable for multiple languages
- Secure storage of linguistic data
- Reliable and accurate AI models
- Works on low-bandwidth networks

## 6. Constraints
